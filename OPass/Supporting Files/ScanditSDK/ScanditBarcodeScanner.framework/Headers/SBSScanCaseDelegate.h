 *
 * \param scanCase The scan case on which codes were scanned.

 *     process, e.g. the list of codes recognized in the last processed frame. The scan session
 *     can only be accessed from within this method. It is however possible to use codes returned
 *     by SBSScanSession#newlyRecognizedCodes outside this method.

 *     or return SBSScanCaseStateStandby if you want to pause the scanner.
