/**
 * \brief Holds all barcodes that were decoded in the current session.
 *
 * <h2>Configuring Session Behavior</h2>
 *
 * The scan session is responsible for determining the list of "relevant" barcodes
 * by filtering out duplicates. Depending on your app, different duplicate removal
 * is required. For some applications, only one barcode is required. The scanning
 * process is stopped as soon as one code is decoded. For other applications,
 * multiple codes are scanned after another. For example, a scanner at the cash
 * desk may need to scan multiple products. To avoid duplicates, the same barcode
 * should not be scanned in short succession. The same barcode (data, symbology)
 * should not count as a duplicate if encountered again after a few seconds.
 *
 * By default, if a barcode has the same symbology and data as code that was
 * decoded less than 1000ms ago, it is filtered out as a duplicate.
 *
 * <h2>Session Lifetime</h2>
 *
 * The session is cleared when \ref SBSScanCase state changes from \ref SBSScanCaseStateOff
 * to \ref SBSScanCaseStateActive, or when the user manually clears the session using
 * \ref SBSScanCaseSession#clear.
