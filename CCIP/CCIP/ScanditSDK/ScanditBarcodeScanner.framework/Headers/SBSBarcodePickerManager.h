/**
 * \brief Manages a barcode picker instance, allocating and releasing it dependent on need.
 *
 * Alternatively to directly allocating a SBSBarcodePicker you can use an SBSBarcodePickerManager
 * to get a SBSBarcodePicker instance. By using the manager it is possible to allocate a picker when
 * the app knows that it will likely need to scan a barcode soon such that when the app actually
 * displays the picker the camera is already running and there is no delay for the user.
 *
 * There are three important concepts for understanding the functionality of the manager:
 * - Registering/unregistering need: An object can register need for the picker which will cause 
 * the manager to keep a running instance of the picker available for future use (by any object not 
 * just the registered one).
 * - Requesting/releasing picker: An object can request the picker to use it. The object does not
 * have to register need before requesting the picker directly. As only one object can ever use the
 * picker at the same time this call is asynchronous.
 * - Freeze/unfreeze picker:
 *
 * **Important:** Be aware that the manager caches the running camera to be able to eliminate the 
 * delay that would be needed to start the camera this will lead to increased battery usage.

 * The time in seconds until the picker is deallocated after the last object that has registered

 * is registered but the picker was requested and is currently in use it will never be deallocated.
 *
 * It is generally not a good idea to set this to 0 seconds as there may be times (for example when
 * animating between view controllers) where there is no need for a split second.

 * we expect it to not be requested in the near future.

 * If the picker was requested and is in use it will never be deallocated no matter how much time
 * has passed.

 * By default this is set to 30. Setting it to 0 causes the manager to never deallocate the picker
